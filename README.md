# 🧠 AI Intermediate Course – GitHub Code Repository Overview

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **AI Intermediate** course. This repo is your central hub for all interactive coding labs, Python scripts, and exercises used throughout the course.

This file will walk you through:

- 🗂 What's in this repository
- 🔁 How to navigate and run each code lab
- 🧪 Tips for experimenting with code
- 💬 How to use GitHub Discussions to learn with others

---

## 🗂 Repository Structure

The repository is organised by **lesson number and topic**, aligned with your course curriculum.

Each folder corresponds to a specific lesson and includes:

- 📁 Python scripts used in code labs  
- 📘 A lesson-level `README.md` that explains the core activity or lab  
- 🎯 Challenges or mini-projects to help reinforce your learning  

**Lessons Included:**

- `Lesson 2 - Machine Learning`
- `Lesson 3 - Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning`
- `Lesson 4 - Neural Networks`
- `Lesson 5 - Deep Learning`
- `Lesson 7 - AI In Production`

## ⚙️ How to Run the Code

Each lesson's folder contains Python scripts.

### ✅ Before You Start:
1. **Create a new virtual environment** for this course to keep dependencies clean.
2. **Install required packages** using:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if available)
   - or install directly: `pip install scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pandas tensorflow keras` depending on the lesson

### 🚶 Navigating to a Lesson Folder

To work with code from a specific lesson:

```bash
cd "Lesson 3 - Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning"
```

Then run the code via VSCode or your preferred IDE.

## 🧪 Experiment and Explore

Each code lab is designed to help you:

- Understand a concept (e.g. Random Forests, K-Means, Neural Networks)
- Modify input parameters and see how outputs change
- Visualise predictions, accuracy, feature importance, and more

🎯 **Challenge yourself**:
- Try different datasets (like Titanic or Fashion MNIST)
- Change the model (e.g. switch from DecisionTree to KNN)
- Adjust hyperparameters to see the effect on performance

---

## 💬 Collaborate in the Discussions Tab

Learning is better together!

👉 Head to the **[Discussions](../../discussions)** tab to:

- Ask questions about code labs
- Share your results or experiments
- Help others who are stuck
- Post your mini-projects or stretch solutions

Don't be afraid to ask "basic" questions this course is designed to help you grow confidently, no matter your starting point.

## 🔚 Final Notes

This repo is an open learning companion. Use it alongside the videos, slides, and interaction blocks in the AI Intermediate course.

Have fun, keep experimenting, and don't forget:

>  "The best way to learn AI is to build it."

Happy coding!
